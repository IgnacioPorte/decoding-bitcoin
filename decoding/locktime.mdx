<TransactionCreation enabledFields={["locktime"]} />

The locktime field is a 4-byte value that specifies the earliest time a transaction can be added to the blockchain.

Let's examine our transaction to understand this better:

<div className="dark:hidden w-full rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/decoding-bitcoin/static/images/topics/transactions/fees/tx-locktime.png"
        width="100%"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>
<div className="hidden dark:block w-full rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/decoding-bitcoin/static/images/topics/transactions/fees/tx-locktime.png"
        width="100%"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>

In our example transaction, we can see the locktime value is `00000000`. This means:

-   The transaction is valid immediately (can be included in the next block)
-   No timelock restrictions are applied
-   This is the most common locktime value used in Bitcoin transactions

## Locktime Values

The interpretation of the locktime value depends on its range:

<div className="overflow-x-auto">
  <table className="min-w-full bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
    <thead className="bg-orange-100 dark:bg-orange-900">
      <tr>
        <th className="px-6 py-3 text-left text-sm font-semibold">Locktime Value</th>
        <th className="px-6 py-3 text-left text-sm font-semibold">Interpretation</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody className="divide-y divide-gray-200 dark:divide-gray-800">
      <tr className="hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800">
        <td className="px-6 py-4 whitespace-nowrap"><code>0</code></td>
        <td className="px-6 py-4">Transaction is valid immediately (most common)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr className="hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800">
        <td className="px-6 py-4 whitespace-nowrap"><code>< 500.000.000</code></td>
        <td className="px-6 py-4">Interpreted as a block height</td>
      </tr>
      <tr className="hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800">
        <td className="px-6 py-4 whitespace-nowrap"><code>≥ 500.000.000</code></td>
        <td className="px-6 py-4">Interpreted as a Unix timestamp</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

For example:

-   Locktime of 650000 means the transaction is invalid until block 650000
-   Locktime of 1640995200 means the transaction is invalid until January 1, 2022 (Unix timestamp)

<ExpandableAlert title="Note" type="info">
    Locktime is only enforced if at least one input has a sequence number below
    0xffffffff. If all inputs have sequence 0xffffffff, the locktime is ignored.
</ExpandableAlert>

## Implementation Example

Here's how you might parse a transaction's locktime:

<CodeSnippet
    code={`def parse_locktime(raw_tx: bytes, offset: int = 0) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """
    Parse locktime from raw transaction bytes
    
    Args:
        raw_tx: Raw transaction bytes
        offset: Starting position in bytes
        
    Returns:
        (locktime, new_offset)
    """
    # Read 4 bytes for locktime
    locktime_bytes = raw_tx[offset:offset + 4]
    
    # Convert to integer (little-endian)
    locktime = int.from_bytes(locktime_bytes, 'little')
    
    return locktime, offset + 4`}
    language="python"
/>

## Use Cases

### 1. Time-Delayed Transactions

Locktime can be used to create transactions that only become valid in the future:

<CodeSnippet
    code={`def create_future_tx(block_height: int) -> bytes:
    """Create a transaction valid only after specific block height"""
    tx = Transaction()
    # ... add inputs and outputs ...
    
    # Set locktime to future block
    tx.locktime = block_height
    
    # Must set sequence < 0xffffffff for locktime to be enforced
    for tx_in in tx.inputs:
        tx_in.sequence = 0xfffffffe
        
    return tx.serialize()`}
    language="python"
/>

### 2. Escrow Transactions

Locktime can be used in escrow services where funds should only be released after a certain time:

<CodeSnippet
    code={`def create_escrow_tx(release_time: int) -> bytes:
    """Create a transaction that releases funds at specific time"""
    tx = Transaction()
    # ... add inputs and outputs ...
    
    # Set locktime to future timestamp
    tx.locktime = release_time
    
    # Enable locktime enforcement
    for tx_in in tx.inputs:
        tx_in.sequence = 0xfffffffe
        
    return tx.serialize()`}
    language="python"
/>

    However, this design was vulnerable to miner manipulation and was later
    replaced by better payment channel designs like the Lightning Network.

## Validation Rules

When validating a transaction with locktime:

1. If all input sequences are 0xffffffff, locktime is ignored
2. Otherwise:
    - If locktime < 500000000: Compare against current block height
    - If locktime ≥ 500000000: Compare against median time past (MTP)
3. Transaction is invalid if current time/height is less than locktime

    Using locktime for time-sensitive applications requires careful
    consideration of block time variance and potential network reorganizations.
