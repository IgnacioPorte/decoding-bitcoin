<TransactionCreation enabledFields={["marker", "flag"]} />

The marker and flag are **optional** fields introduced with **SegWit**.

They indicate that a transaction uses the segregated witness structure defined in **BIP144** (Witness data is required for inputs locked by **P2WPKH**, **P2WSH**, or **P2TR**).

## Marker

Marker indicates that the transaction uses the SegWit transaction format (also known as the extended format).

-   Marker is **1 byte**.
-   Must always be `0x00` to signal a SegWit transaction.

## Flag

-   The flag is **1 byte**.
-   It is currently set to `0x01` in all SegWit transactions.
-   Future upgrades may use different flags.
