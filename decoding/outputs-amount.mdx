<TransactionCreation enabledFields={["amount"]} />

The amount field in a transaction output specifies how many satoshis (the smallest unit of bitcoin) are being assigned to this output.

Let's examine our transaction to understand this better:

<div className="dark:hidden w-full rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/decoding-bitcoin/static/images/topics/transactions/fees/tx-amount.png"
        width="100%"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>
<div className="hidden dark:block w-full rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/decoding-bitcoin/static/images/topics/transactions/fees/tx-amount.png"
        width="100%"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>

## Amount Field Structure

-   **Size**: 8 bytes (64 bits)
-   **Format**: Little-endian integer
-   **Unit**: Satoshis (1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis)
-   **Range**: 0 to 21,000,000 \* 100,000,000 satoshis (maximum bitcoin supply)

<ExpandableAlert title="Note" type="info">
    The amount field uses 8 bytes because the maximum bitcoin supply (21 million
    BTC) in satoshis exceeds what could be stored in 4 bytes (maximum
    ~42.94967296 BTC).
</ExpandableAlert>

## Implementation Example

Here's how you might parse a transaction output's amount:

<CodeSnippet
    code={`def parse_amount(raw_tx: bytes, offset: int = 0) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """
    Parse an amount from raw transaction bytes
    
    Args:
        raw_tx: Raw transaction bytes
        offset: Starting position in bytes
        
    Returns:
        (amount, new_offset)
    """
    # Read 8 bytes for amount
    amount_bytes = raw_tx[offset:offset + 8]
    
    # Convert to integer (little-endian)
    amount = int.from_bytes(amount_bytes, 'little')
    
    return amount, offset + 8`}
    language="python"
/>

## Amount Validation Rules

When validating transaction amounts, nodes must ensure:

1. **Non-negative**: All output amounts must be ≥ 0 satoshis
2. **Input sum ≥ Output sum**: The sum of all input amounts must be greater than or equal to the sum of all output amounts
3. **Maximum supply**: No single output can exceed the maximum bitcoin supply (21 million BTC)

<ExpandableAlert title="Warning" type="warning">
    The difference between input and output amounts becomes the transaction fee,
    which is collected by miners. Be careful not to accidentally set high fees
    by miscalculating output amounts!
</ExpandableAlert>

## Unit Conversion

Here's a helpful function for converting between BTC and satoshis:

<CodeSnippet
    code={`def btc_to_satoshis(btc: float) -> int:
    """Convert BTC amount to satoshis"""
    return int(btc * 100_000_000)

def satoshis_to_btc(sats: int) -> float:
"""Convert satoshi amount to BTC"""
return sats / 100_000_000`}
language="python"
/>

Common conversions:

-   1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis
-   0.00000001 BTC = 1 satoshi
-   0.001 BTC = 100,000 satoshis

<ExpandableAlert title="Historical Note" type="info">
    The term "satoshi" was adopted by the Bitcoin community to honor Bitcoin's
    creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. The small unit size allows for very precise value
    transfer and future-proofs Bitcoin against significant price appreciation.
