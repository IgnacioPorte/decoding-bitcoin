In this project, we'll build our very own Bitcoin Stack simulator!

This project is a substantially larger and more in-depth challenge than the exercises we've seen throughout the course so far. This is a fantastic chance to review what we've learned. It's time to see how to use our newfound skills in a real-world context!

I'm so excited about this one. Let's get into it!
