Alice wants to pay 5 BTC to Bob for a digital item.  
To make this payment, she needs to create a Bitcoin transaction using the unspent outputs (UTXOs) in her wallet.

<ExpandableAlert title="What Are UTXOs?" type="info" expandable={true}>
UTXOs are unspent transaction outputs that can be used as inputs for new transactions.  
Think of UTXOs as the "coins" sitting in Alice's wallet, waiting to be spent.

Alice checks her wallet and finds two UTXOs:

-   **UTXO #1**: 4 BTC
-   **UTXO #2**: 2 BTC

Together, these provide enough funds (6 BTC total) to pay Bob 5 BTC.

</ExpandableAlert>

### 1. Inputs: Where the Money Comes From

To create a transaction, Alice needs to specify which UTXOs she wants to use as inputs.

<div className="dark:hidden w-full rounded-lg">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/decoding-bitcoin/static/images/topics/transactions/transaction2.svg"
        width="100%"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>
<div className="hidden dark:block w-full rounded-lg">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/decoding-bitcoin/static/images/topics/transactions/transaction2.svg"
        width="100%"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>

Alice's wallet shows these available UTXOs:

-   **UTXO #1**: 4 BTC (from Transaction 1, Output Index 1)
-   **UTXO #2**: 2 BTC (from Transaction 2, Output Index 0)

Together, these UTXOs provide enough funds (4 BTC + 2 BTC = 6 BTC) for the payment and any transaction fees.

#### Creating Transaction Inputs

Each input in a Bitcoin transaction must include:

1. The Transaction ID (Where the UTXO came from)
2. The Output Index (Which output from that transaction)
3. A placeholder for the Signature (which will be added when Alice signs the transaction)

<div className="dark:hidden w-full rounded-lg">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/decoding-bitcoin/static/images/topics/transactions/transaction3.svg"
        width="100%"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>
<div className="hidden dark:block w-full rounded-lg">

        width="100%"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>

### 2. Outputs: Where the Money Goes

For this transaction, Alice needs to create two outputs:

-   **5 BTC to Bob** (the payment amount)
-   **0.99 BTC back to Alice** (as change, assuming 0.01 BTC transaction fee)

<div className="dark:hidden w-full rounded-lg">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/decoding-bitcoin/static/images/topics/transactions/transaction4.svg"
        width="100%"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>
<div className="hidden dark:block w-full rounded-lg">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/decoding-bitcoin/static/images/topics/transactions/transaction4.svg"
        width="100%"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>

<ExpandableAlert title="Why Is Change Needed?" type="info" expandable={true}>
In Bitcoin, UTXOs must be spent in their entirety. You cannot partially spend a UTXO.
Instead, you create a new output that sends the excess amount back to yourself as change.

For example: If you have a 6 BTC UTXO and want to send 5 BTC, you must:

1. Spend the entire 6 BTC UTXO
2. Create one output of 5 BTC to the recipient
3. Create another output sending the remaining 1 BTC back to yourself

</ExpandableAlert>

### Transaction Fees

A transaction fee incentivizes miners to include your transaction in a block. The fee is the difference between inputs and outputs:

```
Fee = Total Input Amount - Total Output Amount
```

In this example:

-   Inputs: 6 BTC
-   Outputs: 5 BTC (to Bob) + 0.99 BTC (change)
-   Fee: 0.01 BTC

### Final Step: Signing the Transaction

The transaction structure is now complete but not yet valid. Alice must sign it to prove she owns the inputs.
The signing process will be covered in detail in the [Signing Transactions](/decoding/transaction-signing) topic.
