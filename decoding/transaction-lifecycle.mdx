## The Journey of a Bitcoin Transaction

1. [**Creation**](./transaction-creation): A new transaction is built using unspent outputs (UTXOs)

2. [**Signing**](./transaction-signing): The transaction is signed with the sender's private key

3. [**Broadcasting**](./transaction-broadcasting): The signed transaction propagates through the network

4. [**Validation by Nodes**](./transaction-validation): Network nodes verify the transaction's validity

5. [**Mining**](./transaction-mining): Miners include the valid transaction in a block

Each step has its own dedicated topic where you can learn more about the technical details and processes involved.
