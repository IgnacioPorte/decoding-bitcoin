When sending Bitcoin transactions, we need to pay fees based on how much block space our transaction occupies. There are three main ways to measure a transaction's size:

-   **Transaction Size**: The raw byte count of the transaction
-   **Transaction Weight**: A weighted measure that counts witness data differently
-   **Virtual Bytes (vBytes)**: Used for fee calculations (covered in the next topic on fee rates)

## Transaction Size

The most straightforward measurement is the raw byte count of a transaction:

<div className="text-center my-4 text-orange-500">
    $$\mathbf{Transaction\ Size = Bytes\ of\ serialized\ transaction}$$
</div>

For example, here's a raw transaction in hexadecimal:

<div className="dark:hidden">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/decoding-bitcoin/static/images/topics/transactions/fees/fees_8.svg"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>
<div className="hidden dark:block">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/decoding-bitcoin/static/images/topics/transactions/fees/fees_8.svg"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>
This transaction is 225 bytes long - we simply count the number of characters
and divide by 2 (since each byte is represented by 2 hex characters).

## Transaction Weight

With the introduction of SegWit, a new measurement called "transaction weight" was created:

<div className="text-center my-4 text-orange-500">
    $$\mathbf{Transaction\ Weight = (Base\ Size Ã— 4) + Witness\ Size}$$
</div>

Where:

-   **Base Size** = Size of transaction data without witness data (signatures)
-   **Witness Size** = Size of witness data (signatures) only

<div className="dark:hidden">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/decoding-bitcoin/static/images/topics/transactions/fees/fees_7.svg"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>
<div className="hidden dark:block">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/decoding-bitcoin/static/images/topics/transactions/fees/fees_7.svg"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>
<ExpandableAlert title="NOTE" type="info">
    ðŸ’¡ For legacy (non-SegWit) transactions, all data is considered base size
    and witness size is zero.
</ExpandableAlert>

## Why Use Weight? Enter SegWit

Transaction weight was introduced alongside Segregated Witness (SegWit) to solve several problems:

1. **Transaction Malleability**: A security issue where anyone could modify a transaction's signature (and thus its ID) before confirmation, without invalidating the transaction (more on this later).
2. **Block Space Efficiency**: Signatures take up ~65% of transaction data
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Needed a way to increase block capacity without a hard fork

SegWit achieves this by separating transaction data into two parts:

-   **Base data**: Transaction structure including inputs, outputs, version, and locktime (everything except signatures)
-   **Witness data**: Signatures and other data needed to validate the transaction, stored separately in the "witness" section

<div className="dark:hidden">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/decoding-bitcoin/static/images/topics/transactions/fees/fees_5.svg"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>
<div className="hidden dark:block">
    <SvgDisplay
        src="/decoding-bitcoin/static/images/topics/transactions/fees/fees_5.svg"
        height="auto"
    />
</div>
